# TJ Seating Project
### Background Information

Featured in newspaper [[TribLive]](https://triblive.com/local/southhills/13397055-74/thomas-jefferson-hs-student-digitizes-spring-musical-ticket-reservations)

My senior year of high school, I noticed a large problem in the theater department with ticket sales. They were not only able to not keep track of customers, but they were also vastly inneficient. Combining my programming knowledge and passion for theater, I created a realtime, SQL based ticket purchasing software for my high school. 
In 2019, I was again asked to build a seating application for the school. Now in college, I decided to utilize some different technologies to improve system performance (visible under technical information).
More information can be found in the newspaper link above.

## Technical Information
Built using JavaFX and Google Firestore in 2019.
Built using Java AWT and MySQL in 2017-18.

Users (ticket sellers) can open multiple clients and connect to the database. As tickets are sold, each users' screen will update with realtime information reflecting the update.

## Future Plans
Future plans for this project include implementing it into a website so that customers may purchase tickets from their home.
This will be made available on my github portfolio.
